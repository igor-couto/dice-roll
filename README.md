# Dice Roll

[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/igor-couto/dice-roll/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/igor-couto/dice-roll/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml)

This project was created as a playground to experiment with CSS animations, explore .NET 9, and utilize the `Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator` instead of `System.Random`.

While Random is generally more performant and suitable for typical use cases, RandomNumberGenerator offers cryptographically secure randomness, which ensures higher unpredictability. It's completely unnecessary here but I wanted to test it anyway ðŸ˜€
